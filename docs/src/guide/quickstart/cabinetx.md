# CabinetX: a simple parametric cabinet

## What we'll make

![CabinetX quickstart](/quickstart_closetx.webp)

ðŸš§ Making a cabinet is a good way to start modeling with rectangles and boxes and making simple arrangements with them.
Of course Archiyou offers a lot of ways to make rectangular models: using primitives like _box()_, _plane()_ and operations like _Shape.extrude()_, _Shape.array()_. There is also a powerful _Shape.align()_ and _Shape.select()_ function to arrange shapes in relation to each other.

This example is available as file _CursusKast_ under _File -> Open -> Shared Scripts_.

## Step 1: Parameters and left side

Start by defining your parameter variables in the Parameter menu. We need at least:

* _WIDTH_ - type: number, start: 30, end: 200 (or something in this range)
* _DEPTH_ - type: number, start: 30, end: 120
* _HEIGHT_ - type: number, start: 40, end: 300
* _NUM_PLANKS_ - type: number, start: 3, end: 10

Units are centimeters. You can tell Archiyou with _units('cm') and set them in the Parameter definitions.
The current values of the parameters can be plugged into the script by referring to their name with a '$'. So _$WIDTH_, _$DEPTH_ etc.

Let's make the left side of the cabinet with this code:

```js
sideLeft = box(2,$DEPTH,$HEIGHT) // make a box
            .align(vertex(),  // align it to [0,0,0] - vertex() defaults to [0,0,0]
                'bottomfrontleft',
                'center')
```

Run it and you should see something like this:

![CabinetX: parameters and left side](/closetx_step1.png)

The code is pretty simple, but there are some interesting things going on:

* box()._align(other:Shape, pivot:Pivot, alignment:Alignment)_ - This aligns the _bottomfrontleft_ corner of the box the origin ([0,0,0]) of the scene.
* _vertex()_ in the above command is shorthand. If you don't supply coordinates to this function it will default to [0,0,0]. So this is the same: vertex(0,0,0)


## Step 2: The other side and the first plank

Since the right side shape is the same as the left we can just copy the latter and move it along the x-axis at a distance of the width of the cabinet (_$WIDTH_). The command _Shape.moved()_ does exactly that!

```js
sideRight = sideLeft.moved($WIDTH);
```

::: tip
For most operations Archiyou offers two versions: one on the current Shape and the other making a copy and then doing the operation:
```js
box().move(100); // moves the one box
box().moved(100); // copies and then moves the one box: now there are two boxes!
// other examples:
box().scale(2);
box().scaled(2);
// and so on!
```
:::

So now create the last shape that we need: a simple plank. It's always a good idea to stick to code that corresponds to how you would explain a plank verbally to a person: _it's between this side and that side_. This is the code:

```js
plank = planebetween(
            sideLeft.select('V||frontrightbottom'), // the front-right-bottom corner of the left side
            sideRight.select('V||backleftbottom')
        ).extrude(2)
```

* _planebetween()_ makes a plane between two points (or anything that looks like a point: _Vertex_ )
* _sideLeft.select('V||frontrightbottom')_ and __sideLeft.select('V||frontrightbottom')_ supply these points by selecting a specific vertex from the both sides. Read more on [selectors here](../modeling/model-access.md)
* _planebetween(..).extrude(2)_ - Lastly we give the plane a thickness of 2cm

When you run the code now you would something like this:

![CabinetX: sides and plank](/closetx_step2.png)

## Step 3: All the planks

Let's get some storage space ðŸ“š by simply creating the right number of planks (_$NUM_PLANKS_) with a distance of _($HEIGHT-2)/($NUM_PLANKS-1)_ between them.

```js
plank.arrayZ($NUM_PLANKS,($HEIGHT-2)/($NUM_PLANKS-1)); // -2 = 2 cm of plank thickness
// There are actually $NUM_PLANKS-1 gaps between the planks
```

This is the end result:

## Full code

```js
units('cm');

sideLeft = box(2,$DEPTH,$HEIGHT)
            .align(vertex(),
            'bottomfrontleft',
            'center')

sideRight = sideLeft.moved($WIDTH);
plank = planebetween(
            sideLeft.select('V||frontrightbottom'),
            sideRight.select('V||backleftbottom')
        ).extrude(2)

// X planks means X-1 spaces between ~ offsets
plank.arrayZ($NUM_PLANKS,($HEIGHT-2)/($NUM_PLANKS-1));

all().color('blue'); // just color everything blue
```
