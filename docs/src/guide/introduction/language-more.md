# A Changing Scripting Language

We think iteration is key to establish the Archiyou scripting language as a effective and fun way to create shapes, make components and combine them into larger models. In other words the core of Archiyou will change quite a bit 🌷.

## 👐 Open Source

The core of Archiyou will be open sourced soon after the alpha launch in 2022. In this way you can always run your scripts and generate your models anyway and anywhere. You can also extend the capabilities of Archiyou and contribute it back. 

## ䷉ Version management, upgrade and deprecation

With a changing language Archiyou will need to offer versioned execution engines to guarantee that a script is run on the version in which it was created. This will be introduced after the alpha launch.
