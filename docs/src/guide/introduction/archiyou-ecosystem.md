# The Archiyou ecosystem

The Archiyou platform consists of a growing collection of parts:

* 💻 [Component Code Editor](https://alpha.archiyou.com): This is the app designers use to create their models with the code.
* 📙 [Manual](https://docs.archiyou.com): The docs contain the guide, quickstart examples and API reference.
* 🦜 [Forum](https://forum.archiyou.com): Where you can ask questions, share insights and connect to the Archiyou team and other users.
* 👨‍💻 [API docs](https://apidocs.archiyou.com): The API docs are for developers to have a full reference of classes, properties and methods
* 🗄 [Archiyou Community Platform](https://alpha.archiyou.com): In the background users can already re-use, import and share their scripts with each other. In the future the platform will come more on the foreground. 

We are working on the following parts:

* 👁️ Design viewer and documentation: A way to only view the model and customize it. This will be for consumers of design. 
* 📚 Design library: We want to create a library of the best open designs for consumers.
* ⛅ Archiyou API: Archiyou will offer a REST API to generate cool models directly from your app
* ⛅ Cloud Compute: Archiyou will offer computations on the cloud in the background.
