# Introduction

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Archiyou docs!

Archiyou is an online platform for open parametric design. This is the documentation section. 

## How to use this documentation

Depending on your perspective you can use this documentation in various ways:

* For the general public and beginners: First check if Archiyou is something for you at [What and why Archiyou?](./why-archiyou.md)
* For programmers who want to model using code: You might want to jump directly to the [Modeling Guide](../modeling/index.md) or have a look at the API reference [TODO]. Very soon we'll also open source the core Archiyou library so your scripts can run everywhere
* For designers: You might not be used to coding. Have a look at our [quickstart examples](../quickstart/index.md) to see if you like the potential. Then start at the [introduction](./why-archiyou.md) and get practical with our [Modeling Guide](../modeling/index.md).
* You just want some nice paramatric designs? This is coming soon!

Lets continue to the next section [What and why Archiyou](./why-archiyou.md).
