* 📋 *Script Editor*: This is the main editor where you code and make objects (and might re-use as blocks), save scripts and directly export models.
* 🎛️ *Script menu*: Like a familiar menu where you can open, rename and publish scripts
* ▶️ *The execute button*: Click to run the script
* 🌷 *Viewer*: After your script is executed the resulting Model is shown in the Viewer. You can navigate with the mouse and change the model quality.
* 🎚️ Parameters menu: Here you can create various parameters and reference them in your script
* 💬 Console: All the output of execution for debug and checking
* ⌛ Version History: This will allow you to go back in time to earlier version of your script
* 🌱 Scene Navigator: This shows the structure of your model with Objects and Shapes
* 📊 Calc: This shows the data behind the model and allows you to create dashboards
